# step-by-step-to-implement-a-neural-network
step-by-step, implement a neural network with python and numpy to recognize handwritten number. 

this work was done for eassily understanding a neural network!

todo:
1. mode documentation (about how to understand a BP ANN and implemente one by yourself)
2. use other optimization algorithm in order to get faster train.
