# step-by-step---implement-a-neural-network
step-by-step, implement a neural network with python and numpy to recognize handwritten number. I create this toy program to teach you backpropagation based artifical neural network, a short python implementation.

artificial neural network is neither magical nor difficult to understand, a toy example that you can play with could help you understand it easily, this work was done for an eassier understanding a neural network model!

todo:

1. more comments (about how to easily understand a back propogation ANN model and implemente one by yourself).

2. use other optimization algorithm (instead of pure gradient descent) in order to get faster train.

3. create another toy programm in a distributed system, like in spark
